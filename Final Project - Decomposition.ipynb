    "The project goal is to analyze the current product range of the E-Commerce business, identify opportunities for optimization, and develop a set of actionable recommendations to increase sales and profitability. By optimizing the product range, we aim to improve the customer experience, increase customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive business growth."

    "1. Define the research question and objectives:\n",
    "- What is the current product range of the E-Commerce business?  \n",
    "- Which products are the most popular and profitable?  \n",
    "- Which products are not performing well and should be discontinued or improved?  \n",
    "- How can the product range be optimized to increase sales and profitability?  \n",
    "- Can we identify statistically significant differences between the performance of different product categories or price ranges?\n",
    "- Can we use a machine learning model to predict product demand and optimize the product range?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check the data:  \n",
    "- Review the data to ensure that they are complete and accurate.\n",
    "- Identify any missing data, outliers or inconsistencies in the data.\n",
    "- Remove duplicates and try to fill the missing values.\n",
    "- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the product range and customer behavior.\n",
    "- Visualize the data to identify patterns and trends.\n",
    "- Build a correlation matrix and display it.\n",
    "- Adding a column only with the date.\n",
    "- Check if data types are right.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Analyze the product range:  \n",
    "- Group products by category, similar name, price range, and other relevant factors.  \n",
    "- Calculate metrics such as revenue, profit per month, and quantity per month for each product and category.  \n",
    "- Identify the most and least popular products, as well as those with the highest and lowest profit.  \n",
    "- Evaluate the performance of the product range as a whole and identify areas for improvement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Machine Learning:\n",
    "- Use classification models to identify the most and least profitable products and optimize the product range.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Test the statistical hypotheses:\n",
    "- Hypothesis: There is a significant difference in sales between weekdays and weekends.  \n",
    "Test: Two-sample t-test comparing the mean sales on weekdays versus weekends.\n",
    "- Hypothesis: There is a significant difference in sales between different product categories.  \n",
    "Test: One-way ANOVA test comparing the mean sales of different product categories.\n",
    "- Hypothesis: There is a correlation between the quantity of items purchased and the total sales.  \n",
    "Test: Pearson's correlation coefficient test between the Quantity and Unit Price columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Develop recommendations:  \n",
    "- Based on the analysis, develop recommendations for optimizing the product range.  \n",
    "- Determine which products should be discontinued, improved, or added to the range.  \n",
    "- Develop pricing strategies to maximize profitability.\n",
    "- Identify opportunities to improve customer experience, such as offering product bundles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Implement and monitor:  \n",
    "- Implement the recommended changes to the product range.  \n",
    "- Monitor performance metrics to evaluate the impact of the changes.  \n",
    "- Adjust strategies as needed to continue optimizing the product range and maximizing profitability.  "
